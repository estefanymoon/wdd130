    <h2>Estef</h2>
    <p>Hey, my name is Estefany, I'm 25 years old and I'm from Caracas, Venezuela but I currently live in Charlotte, NC.</p>

    <p>I have a degree in System engineering from Venezuela and I'm really excited to study Applied Technology.</p>
    
    <p>I've been married for 3 years. We don't have any kids yet but we have a Mini-Aussie puppy that we consider our first child lol.</p>
    <p>I'm happy to be in this studying journey again and I'm excited to be part of this group and learn from all of you.</p> 
    <p>This is new.</p>
