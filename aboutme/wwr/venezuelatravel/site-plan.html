        Venezuela, a country located in the Northern part of South America, is one of the most beautiful countries 
        in the world. It is often described as a magically beautiful country with picturesque waterfalls, lagoons, 
        white sand beaches and mountains. People often travel here to visit its unique natural parks and natural 
        wonders, ancient monuments of the pre-Columbian era, and its magnificent beaches, which attract visitors 
        from all other the world for their beautiful white sands and water conditions which offer excellent 
        opportunities to practice windsurfing and kiting. </p>
      <p>Venezuela’s natural landscape offers a diverse array of attractions for visitors.  Venezuela boasts more 
        than 1,700 miles of coastline and is home to more than 300 islands including an archipelago of them called 
        Los Roques. Near the coast in the northwest region of the country lies the Medanos de Coro national park - a unique region 
        of desert in this tropical country that includes 130 ft sand dunes. Contrasting this desert landscape is 
        the Amazon Rainforest that reaches as far north as central Venezuela. It is inside this landscape that 
        visitors can find the world’s tallest waterfall, Salta Angel, at a height of 3,212 feet. Another natural 
        beauty is the Cerro el Avila - a mountain that overlooks the capital city, Caracas, with one of the world’s 
        longest gondolas at almost 3 miles in length that can transport a passenger to the top.</p>

      <h3>Salto Angel</h3>
      <p>
        Salto Angel or Angel Falls is the world’s tallest waterfall with a height of 3,212 feet and a recognized 
        UNESCO World Heritage site.  The waterfall lies in the Canaima National Park near the northern tip of the 
        Amazon rainforest. Angel Falls is one of Venezuela’s top tourist attractions, despite the complications 
        involved with reaching this natural wonder. As there are no roads in the Canaima National Park the waterfall 
        must be reached by plane.  Travelers are able to buy airline tickets for around $50 in Puerto Ordaz or 
        Ciudad Bolivar and fly on a small three-to-five seater plane to a base camp.  Here, travelers are able 
        to find humble accommodations at hotels and book tours to the falls. It is recommended that travelers 
        visit between June November during the rainy season as this will make the falls accessible by boat.

      </ul>
      <h3>Los Roques</h3>
      <p>
        The Los Roques archipelago is a small group of Caribbean islands and sandbanks located approx. 80 miles 
        north of Caracas. The islands extend over a total area of 15 square miles and are inhabited by less than 
        2000 people.  The islands also boast an extensive coral reef with 42 coral islands and hundreds of sandbanks.
          Los Roques is among the most important eco-touristic destinations in Venezuela due to its pristine coral 
          reef, and the fact that it is the meeting point of over 50 species of migratory birds, including pelicans 
          and pink flamingos, while underwater one may see dolphins, whales, manta rays, and sea turtles.
	        Due to its remote location, travel to Los Roques can also be quite difficult. Traveling to Los Roques requires 
          a short 35 minute flight from the Simon Bolivar airport in Caracas and costs around $100. From there, travelers
          will need to rent a boat to get off of the main island and see all of the natural beauty that the islands offer.

      </ul>
      <h3>Avila</h3>
      <p>
        Cerro Avila, or Avila mountain in English, is one of the highest mountains in the Cordillera de la Costa mountain 
        range that surrounds the capital city of Venezuela, Caracas. The mountain is part of the larger Avila National Park 
        that is known as “el pulmon de la ciudad,” the lungs of the city.  At the peak of the mountain also lies the Humboldt 
        Hotel. Founded in 1956, the hotel overlooks the city of Caracas and the surrounding national park.
        Travel to the Cerro Avila is quite simple.  Caracas is home to one of the longest gondolas in the world at almost 
        3 miles long. From the outskirts of Caracas one can take the gondola and climb over 7,000 feet to the peak of the mountain.  
        Aside from the gondola, there are also many famous hiking and mountain biking trails that lead to the top of the mountain.

      <h3>Medanos de Coro</h3>
      <p>
        The Medanos de Coro National park in the northwest region of Venezuela is a unique desert landscape in this tropical 
        country with sand dunes that are over 130 feet tall.  Ocean currents and the nearby beginning of the Andes mountain 
        range prevent the region from receiving rainfall. The sand dunes formed after centuries of erosion on the rocky 
        outcroppings from the winds from the Caribbean seas.
        Travel to the national park is relatively simple.  The nearby cities of Maracaibo and Barquisimeto have airports 
        from where travelers will be able to find shuttles to the city of Coro, just outside of the national park. 
        From here travelers can schedule tours to enter the national park and rent dune buggies to enjoy the sand dunes.
